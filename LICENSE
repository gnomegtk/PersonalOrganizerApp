                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that a free program will be
non‑free, simply because a patent is controlling it.  To prevent this, we
include a patent license as part of this license.  The precise terms and
conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

                TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a form called "source code".  A "covered work" is either the unmodified
Program or a work based on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
communicating it as part of a routine network operation.

  An "entity" means a government or any other organization.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of a
work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an application include anything, other than
the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a
Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) is
limited to such components that, alone, are considered part of the System,
or that are needed to run the work, but that are not used directly by the
work.  For example, when a certain command-line tool is distributed with a
Linux operating system, its Software System Libraries are those files,
libraries, and utilities that are not specifically written for the tool,
but that are available as part of the operating system.

  "Installation Information" for a user product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that user product from
a modified version of its corresponding source code.  The information
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified
object code is not prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
communicate, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may communicate covered works to others for the sole
purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or
provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you
comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for
which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the
covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
directions and control, on the same terms and conditions as you hold
yourself under.  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely
if you later release a separate license for the work, under which you
make it available to the recipients.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti‑Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users,
your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological
measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
this License, and provide any other information required by these
terms.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of
section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.
    
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
    
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy.
    
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, this
    requirement may be ignored.
  
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in
an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
    a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding
    Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software
    interchange.
    
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
    a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer,
    valid for at least three years, to give anyone who possesses the object
    code a copy of the Corresponding Source for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing this conveying.
    
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
    offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed
    only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the
    object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
    
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.
    
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
    the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
    subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part can be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this
License without regard to the additional permissions.

          How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible freedom, the best way to achieve this is to make it a free
software work and release it under terms of this General Public License.
To do so, attach the following notices to it.  It is safest to attach them
to the start of each source file to most effectively assert the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
notice and a reference directing the reader to the full notice in the
license file.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
